# Bloc Test App With Different open API's kinds (maybe besides graphQL because i can't find that kind of open api)

A new Flutter Bloc Test project.

## Packages I have used or am going to use: 

- Hive (for saving in favourite and write to DB)
- SharedPreferences for creating new comments/post (may be something will change during the proccess, but the main idea is still the same)
- Flutter_Bloc/Bloc/Cubit 
- Dio package (because I have never used it before) 
- Freezed (for code generation)

I will try to make the application as beautiful as possible. I don't have the mindset of a designer of amazingly beautiful applications (in terms of UI), I just want to use a certain technology stack. This is just a tutorial project where I'm trying to understand the basics of some of the most popular Flutter technologies (nothing fancy)


P.S
I will also post screenshots of my study project if I think it is beautiful enough to be in this portfolio.
